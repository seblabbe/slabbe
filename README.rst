This is an optional package for SageMath containing code I wrote for research.
It contains modules on the following topics.

**Discrete dynamical systems**
  diophantine approximation, Markov transformations, Wang tilings, Lyapunov
  exponents, matrix cocycles, multidimensional continued fraction algorithms,
  polyhedron exchange transformations, 

**Combinatorics**
  2d substitutions, bispecial factors, bond percolation, Dyck word in 3D,
  words, Joyal bijection, languages, Oldenburger sequence, ostrowski
  numeration, partial injections,

**Digital geometry**
  Christoffel graph, discrete subset, discrete plane, double square tiles,
  polyhedron partitions, 

**Vizualization**
  tikzpicture

**Miscellaneous**
  analyze Sage build time, fruit Python classes example, ranking scale

Prerequisites
-------------

Installing slabbe requires a working SageMath installation (with Cython and
gcc). Depending on the usage, it might be necessary to install the optional
packages dot2tex__, glucose__, cryptominisat__ and latte_int__::

    sage -i dot2tex glucose cryptominisat latte_int

__ https://dot2tex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
__ https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/
__ https://www.msoos.org/cryptominisat5/
__ https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/

as well as the external packages ImageMagick__, Graphviz__ and Gurobi__. See
this `thematic tutorial`__ to use Gurobi in SageMath.

On Debian or Ubuntu, one may do::

    sudo apt install graphviz imagemagick

On OSX, one may do after installing Homebrew__::

    sudo brew install graphviz imagemagick

Note that graphviz must be installed *before* dot2tex.

Installation
------------

The module is distributed on PyPI and is easily installed through the Python
package manager pip::

    sage -pip install slabbe

To install the module in your user space (which does not require administrator
rights)::

    sage -pip install slabbe --user

To install the most recent development version::

    sage -pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/seblabbe/slabbe

Usage::

    sage: from slabbe import *

It builds on SageMath
---------------------

It depends heavily on the SageMath library as it uses the following modules:
combinat, functions, geometry, graphs, matrix, misc, modules, numerical,
parallel, plot, probability, rings, sat, sets, structure, symbolic.

SageMath__ is free open source math software that supports research and
teaching in algebra, geometry, number theory, cryptography, and related areas.

Follows the Best practices for scientific computing
---------------------------------------------------

It follows as much as possible the `SageMath general conventions`__ and the
`Best Practices for Scientific Computing`__. Each module is fully documented
and doctested. Before each new release, we make sure that all examples are
working. As the `ReScience Journal`__ says: "*Reproducible science is good.
Replicated Science is better*".

Future inclusion into Sage
--------------------------

Some modules may have a wider interest to the SageMath community
(``tikz_picture.py`` for example) and could be included in SageMath at some
point. Please contact the author if you want to act as a reviewer for some
module(s) and I will create a ticket on trac__ for its inclusion into SageMath.
